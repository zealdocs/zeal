/** \class QuaZipFile quazipfile.h <quazip/quazipfile.h>
 * This is the most interesting class. Not only it provides C++
 * interface to the ZIP/UNZIP package, but also integrates it with Qt by
 * subclassing QIODevice. This makes possible to access files inside ZIP
 * archive using QTextStream or QDataStream, for example. Actually, this
 * is the main purpose of the whole QuaZIP library.
 *
 * You can either use existing QuaZip instance to create instance of
 * this class or pass ZIP archive file name to this class, in which case
 * it will create internal QuaZip object. See constructors' descriptions
 * for details. Writing is only possible with the existing instance.
 *
 * Note that due to the underlying library's limitation it is not
 * possible to use multiple QuaZipFile instances to open several files
 * in the same archive at the same time. If you need to write to
 * multiple files in parallel, then you should write to temporary files
 * first, then pack them all at once when you have finished writing. If
 * you need to read multiple files inside the same archive in parallel,
 * you should extract them all into a temporary directory first.
 *
 * \section quazipfile-sequential Sequential or random-access?
 *
 * At the first thought, QuaZipFile has fixed size, the start and the
 * end and should be therefore considered random-access device. But
 * there is one major obstacle to making it random-access: ZIP/UNZIP API
 * does not support seek() operation and the only way to implement it is
 * through reopening the file and re-reading to the required position,
 * but this is prohibitively slow.
 *
 * Therefore, QuaZipFile is considered to be a sequential device. This
 * has advantage of availability of the ungetChar() operation (QIODevice
 * does not implement it properly for non-sequential devices unless they
 * support seek()). Disadvantage is a somewhat strange behaviour of the
 * size() and pos() functions. This should be kept in mind while using
 * this class.

     * \a zip is the pointer to the existing QuaZip object. This
     * QuaZipFile object then can be used to read current file in the
     * \a zip or to write to the file inside it.
     *
     * \warning Using this constructor for reading current file can be
     * tricky. Let's take the following example:
     * \code
     * QuaZip zip("archive.zip");
     * zip.open(QuaZip::mdUnzip);
     * zip.setCurrentFile("file-in-archive");
     * QuaZipFile file(&zip);
     * file.open(QIODevice::ReadOnly);
     * // ok, now we can read from the file
     * file.read(somewhere, some);
     * zip.setCurrentFile("another-file-in-archive"); // oops...
     * QuaZipFile anotherFile(&zip);
     * anotherFile.open(QIODevice::ReadOnly);
     * anotherFile.read(somewhere, some); // this is still ok...
     * file.read(somewhere, some); // and this is NOT
     * \endcode
     * So, what exactly happens here? When we change current file in the
     * \c zip archive, \c file that references it becomes invalid
     * (actually, as far as I understand ZIP/UNZIP sources, it becomes
     * closed, but QuaZipFile has no means to detect it).
     *
     * Summary: do not close \c zip object or change its current file as
     * long as QuaZipFile is open. Even better - use another constructors
     * which create internal QuaZip instances, one per object, and
     * therefore do not cause unnecessary trouble. This constructor may
     * be useful, though, if you already have a QuaZip instance and do
     * not want to access several files at once. Good example:
     * \code
     * QuaZip zip("archive.zip");
     * zip.open(QuaZip::mdUnzip);
     * // first, we need some information about archive itself
     * QByteArray comment=zip.getComment();
     * // and now we are going to access files inside it
     * QuaZipFile file(&zip);
     * for(bool more=zip.goToFirstFile(); more; more=zip.goToNextFile()) {
     *   file.open(QIODevice::ReadOnly);
     *   // do something cool with file here
     *   file.close(); // do not forget to close!
     * }
     * zip.close();
     * \endcode
