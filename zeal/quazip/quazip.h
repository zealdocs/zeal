/** \class QuaZip quazip.h <quazip/quazip.h>
 * This class implements basic interface to the ZIP archive. It can be
 * used to read table contents of the ZIP archive and retreiving
 * information about the files inside it.
 *
 * You can also use this class to open files inside archive by passing
 * pointer to the instance of this class to the constructor of the
 * QuaZipFile class. But see QuaZipFile::QuaZipFile(QuaZip*, QObject*)
 * for the possible pitfalls.
 *
 * This class is indended to provide interface to the ZIP subpackage of
 * the ZIP/UNZIP package as well as to the UNZIP subpackage. But
 * currently it supports only UNZIP.
 *
 * The use of this class is simple - just create instance using
 * constructor, then set ZIP archive file name using setFile() function
 * (if you did not passed the name to the constructor), then open() and
 * then use different functions to work with it! Well, if you are
 * paranoid, you may also wish to call close before destructing the
 * instance, to check for errors on close.
 *
 * You may also use getUnzFile() and getZipFile() functions to get the
 * ZIP archive handle and use it with ZIP/UNZIP package API directly.
 *
 * This class supports localized file names inside ZIP archive, but you
 * have to set up proper codec with setCodec() function. By default,
 * locale codec will be used, which is probably ok for UNIX systems, but
 * will almost certainly fail with ZIP archives created in Windows. This
 * is because Windows ZIP programs have strange habit of using DOS
 * encoding for file names in ZIP archives. For example, ZIP archive
 * with cyrillic names created in Windows will have file names in \c
 * IBM866 encoding instead of \c WINDOWS-1251. I think that calling one
 * function is not much trouble, but for true platform independency it
 * would be nice to have some mechanism for file name encoding auto
 * detection using locale information. Does anyone know a good way to do
 * it?

     * The file path argument was changed to be of type \c voidpf, and

     * set explicitly via setIoDevice() or the QuaZip(QIODevice*)
     * constructor, or it is created internally when opening the archive
     * by its file name. The default API (qioapi.cpp) just delegates
